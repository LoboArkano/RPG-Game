## About the game

The design of the game was mainly decided with this [tutorial](https://gamedevacademy.org/how-to-create-a-turn-based-rpg-game-in-phaser-3-part-1/). The design was expanded to allow you to explore different locations on the world map; for example a town, a temple, and a dungeon. Each location has its own set of enemies that are chosen at random.

Maps were created using Tiled with the RPG MAKER MV tiles. Some tiles have the custom property "collides", so the player cannot pass through those tiles (walls, objects, etc.).
